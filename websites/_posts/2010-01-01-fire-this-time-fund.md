            <h4 class="ftt pb-4">&mdash; A RESOURCE FOR ALTERNATIVE FUNDING</h4>
            <p>When I joined Fire This Time as a giving circle member, they had no online presence to tell their story or provide resources to other non-traditional philanthropic initiatives in the country.</p>
            <p>Recognizing this need, I volunteered my website design services to provide an online hub that described their guiding principles, linked the application form with annual deadlines, and posted relevant resources and journalism articles.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">Providing Historical Context</h2>
            <h4 class="ftt pb-4">&mdash; ELEVATING COMMUNITY EFFORTS</h4>
            <p>Having no website, the organization had no way of showing what kind of projects were funded in past. We created an annual directory of grant recipients that showcased the diversity and breadth of the organizations supported over the years.</p><p>This directory provided descriptions of each grantee and linked to their websites when possible so others could learn more about them and get involved with funded projects.</p>
            <p>When the fund ended, I took the website off a Content Management System and made a static html site hosted on <a href="https://firethistimefund.github.io/" target="_blank" class="alt-link">Github Pages</a> so this history could continue to be told without the need to pay for hosting.</p>
